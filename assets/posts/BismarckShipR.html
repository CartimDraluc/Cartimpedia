    <p>
        It is May the 22nd , 1941. Heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen and battleship Bismarck departed from the Fjord port.
        Admiral Lütjens led his task force to Denmark Strait, hoping worsening weather would help to break out into Atlantic Ocean without detecting. In the evening of the 23rd of May, they reached the ice limit and set course along the Greenland’s coast. 
        Soon, HMS Suffolk spotted the task force, an hour later, HMS Norfolk also spotted. Operation was no longer a secret. Five salvos were fired from Bismarck, but none of these hit the Norfolk. She quickly retreated into the fog. But British ships were still able to track the group because of Suffolk’s radar. But Bismarck’s radar was broken due to the force of the blast from her owns artillery. As a result, admiral ordered Prinz Eugen to take the lead.
        6 hours later, Prinz Eugen detected the propellers noises from her port side. The mighty battlecruiser, pride of the Royal Navy, HMS Hood, and HMS Prince of Wales approached.  Fierce artillery trade-off ensued resulting in the sinking of Hood, a symbolic British ship. Also damaged the Prince of Wales, forcing her to retreat.
        And now, British Navy ordered all possible ships to hunt down the Bismarck. In 26th of May, a plane spotted the trail of oil, and found the Bismarck. Force H was ordered to sunk the ship.
        HMS King George V and HMS Rodney fired first salvoes at Bismarck. Soon another two British cruisers joined the battle. For the last 90 minutes, Bismarck suffered relentless British fires, causing enormous damage to the ship and huge casualties to the crew. Due to fuel shortage, 3 ships were sent back to the port. Ordered HMS Dorsetshire to finish the job. Eventually, at the 10:39 on the 27th of May, Bismarck, flagship of the Navy went under the waves. A little more than a hundred of sailors were survived.
        The eight-day long voyage of Bismarck became a highlight of the battle of the Atlantic and one of the most famous events in European theater of Second World War.

    <p> The crew from the HMS Cossack rescued the cat from the Sinking Bismarck and named the cat “Oscar”. Again when the Cossack was sunk, HMS Ark Royal rescued him. Ark Royal was survived from several torpedoes attacks and earned the title “The Lucky Ship”. But…no more luck for the Ark Royal. She was sunk by the torpedoes on November 14th ,1941. Unbelievably, the cat is still alive! Oscar had enough. He was transferred to a job on land.

        <li>A salvo is a military tactic that the simultaneous firing of several guns.</li>
        <li>Similar to volley.</li>
        <li>But the two are distinguishable as volley fire is a term related to small arms and infantry.</li>
        <li>Salvo tactic is used by Navy and field artillery with the goal of achieving the maximum amount of fire power as possible in one moment.</li>
